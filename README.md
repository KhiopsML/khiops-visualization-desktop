## 🎯 About

Historically, these were distributed as two distinct desktop apps. Now, their features and codebases have been unified into this single application.

For reference, you can find the old releases here:

- [khiops-visualization releases](https://github.com/KhiopsML/kv-electron/releases)
- [khiops-covisualisation releases](https://github.com/KhiopsML/kc-electron/releases)

The project is based on the [angular-electron](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron) template and uses Angular with TypeScript for the user interface.
